### Describing the Dataset

The [data.gov.in](data.gov.in) website is an Open Government Data Website containing a wide range of datasets divided into sectors such as Health and Family Welfare, Agriculture, Transport, Environment and Forest, Education, Finance, etc. Each sector has hundreds of resources along with APIs, infographics and blogs. The government collects this data so it can keep track of the administrative operations, health and population indices and the economy throughout the country. 

The dataset I picked is the ["National Family Health Survey (NFHS) – 5, 2019-2021"](https://data.gov.in/catalog/national-family-health-survey-5-nfhs-5-india-districts-factsheet-data). It has data regarding the population in various states, (segregated into different genders, age groups, regions (urban/rural)), registered births and deaths, sex ratio, households with electricity, households with basic sanitation facilities, literacy rate, and so on. 

Using this data collected from all over India, the government can see which regions/states it needs to focus on more. Analyzing this data could help the central government understand how the funds allocated in the past to a certain region have been utilized by the local governments, and in the future, it can compare the latest datasets to this one to monitor and track progress. 

This dataset is particularly intriguing because of the nature of the data collected. For example, there’s separate columns for “Sex ratio at birth for children born in the last five years (females per 1,000 males)” and “Sex ratio of the total population (females per 1,000 males)”. India being one of the countries where illegal sex-selective abortions still take place, these columns help us understand where that is happening the most. It could also help us understand the amount of nutrition and care being provided to young boys and girls, depending on their rate of survival. 


### Describing a Data Science Book 

[“The Promise and Peril of Big Data”](https://www.aspeninstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/files/content/docs/pubs/The_Promise_and_Peril_of_Big_Data.pdf) by David Bollier was published by the Aspen Institute. This book report sums up the 3-day round-table event on Information Technology. This roundtable had leaders, businesspersons and scholars from different domains like computer science, statistics, journalism, etc. It covers a diverse range of topics, including but not limited to, ethical and moral boundaries of companies using the data collected without people’s explicit consent, does the “now-casting” respect an individual’s privacy, how are healthcare companies going to use their analytics to provide better care for patients, etc.  

What makes this book interesting is the conversation it sparks around the possible abuse/misuse of Big Data. It talks about how Big Data might give “large corporations new abilities to manipulate consumers or compete unfairly in the marketplace”. The book report goes into detail about “Social Perils Posed by Big Data”, “Protecting Medical Privacy”, along with “How Should Big Data Abuses be Addressed?”. The sociological implications of Big Data are rarely discussed at such length and that’s something I haven’t seen before. It’s an interesting read with a lot of thought-provoking material, especially for a beginner learning the depths which Big Data can reach, with the right minds and tools put together.
